I'm Meijie Wang, I held a bachelor of architecture and worked as an architect for two years, now I am a first year graduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute  major in interactive media & game development. I'm interested in human computer interaction and tangible media. This website contains a portfolio of my work in CS 3041, Human Computer Interaction, and a design manifesto detailing the design process I developed over the course of the term.

All of the projects below were a collaborative effort and reflect group work.

# Design for Others

Design for Others was insightful and eye opening to the entire process of adapting websites to mobile platforms, and even developing one from scratch. Appealing to our audience proved to be the main priority when thinking about our design decisions, and we hope that if a member of our audience ever gets the chance to try our website, they have a pleasant user experience.


# Design for Understanding

Design for understanding was a task which requires mapping data to visual features for communicating information by leveraging the rapid perceptual pathways in our brain.We started the project by selecting a unique dataset and went about exploring it from different perspectives. With the five design-sheet methodology, we brainstormed and refined our ideas into four visualizations we felt could portray and accurate picture of our dataset. To make a Persuasive communication and storytelling data visualization, we exert our creativity and visual imagination. Through our user testing, we were able to refine our prototypes into solid final products. And our final product did have a long-lasting impact on users according to feedback.

Design for Tension is my first project engaged in chat bots is a useful and fun way to learn a topic. The interaction throughout the process is very interesting and engaging. I find that users are usually willing to think of the robots they chat with as humans, and occasionally respond to chat robot conversations in a humorous way. In addition, chat bots have the unique ability to personalize the user experience, providing users with redundant information about the topic and providing a natural way to explore topics in a similar conversation on a voluntary basis. Throughout the process, we have designed the chatter robot to become a novel tool to display ideas and forces people to reflect on their own beliefs.


# Design for Wellbeing

Design for Wellbeing is a technically difficult project. I have never been exposed to Affectiva technology before this task. Many times our implementation of ideas is limited by technical capabilities. This makes me feel the importance of learning programming. After studying the algorithm of Affectiva technology, it has also been greatly inspired. I hope that I will have more opportunities to use Affectiva technology in the future.


# Design for Another World

Design for Another World extended our knowledge of ways to implement VR. In this project, VR served as a marketing or a showcasing medium for users to take a tour in a building. VR adds another layer of convenience to our daily lives by saving the travel time and money to experience the foreign environment. Once the VR technique finally develops to a certain point, it would be a huge breakthrough for human to experience and sense any place across time and space.
